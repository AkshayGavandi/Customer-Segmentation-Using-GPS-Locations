The importance of segmentation is that it allows the business to reach a customer with specific needs and wants. It improves the convenience of the customer in accessing services and in long run benefits the companies as their target customers are focused groups which means effective usage of resources.

The goal of the research project is to divide the customers into groups of similar characteristics. This can be achieved by observing the location data of the users. Frequent visits to a location by a group of people determines the segmentation. For example: People frequently visiting a place marked as Northeastern University are categorized as students. This helps business advertisers around the university area to attract student category customers by introducing offers like back to school more efficiently.
